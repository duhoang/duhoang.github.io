        <p>I joined <strong>AdFin</strong> shortly after the launch of their MVP. My challenge was to transform a dry and overwhelmingly technical analytics platform into something that is visually attractive and user friendly.</p>
                    <p>To do this I use bold typography and colors that not only add visual interest, but also convey the underlying hierachy of the design. I then drastically simplified the graphs and charts, and made them really clean and easy to digest.</p>
                    <p>Working with <strong>AdFin</strong> allowed me to explore the craft of data visualization. It introduced me to Object Oriented Javascript, D3.js data visualization framework, and Facebook's application framework, React.js.
                    </p>
                    <p>After the redesign, we began creating new products from scratch. It was a great learning experience in designing something from nothing, and the process of design in an early stage startup that is still looking for product market fit.

          <div class="section-info">
              <p>I'm a practitioner of Goal-Directed Design and my design process starts with user research and the crafting of personas. This is a crucial first step towards understanding the users' goals and pain points, and to ensure that our designs address their needs.
                </p>
                <p>    The reality of working in a small startup, in an emerging field like VR, is that you often do not have the resources or a large enough user base to perform comprehensive user research in accordance to formal UX methods. In this case, you'll have to be tactical with your process; make use the UX tools that are available to you, then work to fill the missing gaps in knowledge with iterative designs and prototypes to validate your ideas and assumptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>   At Imeve, we conducted a series of stakeholder interviews and creative exercises where we envision a future in which VR headsets are readily available to everyone, and hypothesized about their use cases and solutions as they pertain to our core technology. We followed the UX design playbook as much as possible; modeling our user behaviors, creating scenarios and key paths, and generating design artifacts such as storyboards and diagrams along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>   VR is a new horizon for UX/UI design, and as such, we cannot rely on many of the existing design patterns and conventions. It is often necessary to invent new interactions and paradigms, and for that, we take a lot of our inspirations from video games, sci-fi movies and the real world. When all else fail, we dream up new possibilities from our imagination then test them rigorously with design prototypes.
