          <p>As a practitioner of Goal-Directed Design, my design process begins with user research and the creation of personas. Because only when we have an understanding of the users, their goals and pain points, can we ensure that our designs address their needs.</p>
<p>This is no different in a VR product than it is in a 2D product. The same UX playbook of stakeholder/user interviews, mapping user journeys, storyboarding scenarios, wireframes, prototypes and iteration, all still applies. </p>
<p>What is unique about designing VR UX is the newness of the technology, and the unknowns that that entails. We cannot readily rely on existing design patterns and conventions.  And often it is necessary to invent new UX paradigms. Luckily we can look to the real world for inspiration, and sci-fi literatures and movies.</p>
<p>There are also technical challenges and limitations particular to current VR technology, from motion sickness to vergence-accommodation conflict, that VR UX has to resolve. Research and development then becomes an integral part of designing for VR. We need to constantly experiments with new ways of interaction, and make sure that our users are not adversely affected.</p>

          <div class="section-info">
            <p>We are currently in a transitional period where many users are being introduced to VR for the first time. One strategy for VR UI design is to translate familiar 2D interfaces into 3D space. This is a quick way to onboard users and allow for the transfer of interaction skills from one platform into another. We can also make use of physical interfaces (handles, switches, street signs, etc.) to similar effects in VR.</p>

<p>When employing this method it is important to meet the expectation of the user, that the interaction in 2D or the physical world would carry over into VR and have the same predictable result.</p>

<p>The other thing to keep in mind is the differences between each medium. Ergonomics of 2D interfaces have been largely standardized with the use of the keyboard and mouse. But a UI in VR must grapples with a user's physical build, mobility and fitness. For example, placing a button too high up can put it out of reach for some users, and can cause neck strain or discomfort for others trying to reach it. And while physical UIs are constrained by physical forces (gravity, space, time, etc.), VR UIs does not have to obey those laws.</p>

<p>The environment plays a big role in VR UI design. It creates the world where the UI lives, and therefore, the UI has to be believable in the context of that universe. Sound effects also become an indispensable part of the UI, and help further immerse the user into the environment.</p>

<p>A crucial skillset to have when designing for VR is prototyping. The ability to quickly build design prototypes to validate new ideas is an incredible asset in a field where there are few established standards. Designers are only beginning to scratch the surface of VR design, and as we explore new design patterns, discovering novel interactions, we must be able to test and validate our findings.</p>
