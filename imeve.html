        <div class="section-info">
          <p>As a practitioner of Goal-Directed Design, my design process begins with user research and the creation of personas. Because only when we understand the users, their goals and pain points, can we ensure that our designs address their needs.</p>
          <p>This is no different in a VR product than it is in a 2D product. The usual UX playbook of stakeholder/user interviews, mapping user journeys, storyboarding scenarios, wireframes, prototypes and iteration, all still applies. </p>
          <p>What is unique about designing VR UX is the newness of the technology, and the unknowns that that entails. One cannot readily rely on existing design patterns and conventions, and often it is necessary to invent new UX paradigms. Luckily we can look to the real world for inspiration, and that of sci-fi literatures and movies.</p>
          <p>There are also technical challenges and limitations particular to current VR technology to consider. From motion sickness to vergence-accommodation conflict that, things that VR UX has to resolve. R&D then becomes an integral part of designing for VR. We need to constantly experiments with new ways of interaction, and at the same time, make sure that our users are not adversely affected.</p>

          <div class="section-info">
            <p>We're in a transitional period where many users are being introduced to VR for the first time. One strategy for VR UI design is to translate familiar 2D interfaces into 3D. This is a quick way to onboard users and allow for the transfer of interaction skills from one domain to another. We can also make use of familiar physical objects (handles, switches, street signs, etc.) to similar effects.</p>
<p>When employing this method it is important to meet the user's expectation, that the familiar interactions would carry over into VR and have the same predictable result.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is ergonomics. VR UI must grapples with a user's physical build, mobility and fitness, and account for the exertion of each interaction to minimize physical strain. On the flip side, VR UI need not be constrained by the laws of physics. As such, teleportation and telekinesis are common devices in VR interactions.</p>
<p>The environment plays a big role in VR UI design. It is the world where the UI exist, and therefore, the UI has to be believable in the context of that universe. Sound effects also become an indispensable part of the UI, and help further immerse the user into the environment.</p>
